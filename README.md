A simple app that help manages library checkouts for my school. Currently only made to track loaner chromebooks. 
Future plans include support for library books, projectors, and other library materials.
I am also planning on adding support for a barcode scanner to read the numbers instead of manually adding the info.
The plan is to run this app on an RPI 3 with a touchscreen for input, eventualy the barcode scanner will also be input.
